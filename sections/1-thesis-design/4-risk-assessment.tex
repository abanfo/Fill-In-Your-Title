% Describe the risks which you could run into and how you will mitigate them.
%Write about the risks of your project here. Focus on risks that may challenge you finishing on time (such as not getting high-quality (labelled) data on time, difficulties with modelling, having to wait on key stakeholders, etc.) and how you plan to mitigate them.%

Due to my work schedule of five days a week for 40 hours and attending school part-time, I am finding it challenging to make time for my thesis project. This lack of time may cause a delay in completing the project. I plan to work on the thesis during weekends and holidays, but this may be difficult if my employer assigns me tasks with tight deadlines. As a result, I may have to sacrifice my social and leisure time to complete this project.
