\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
% Focus on what you add to the existing method. Explain what you will do and why (and how). Do not forget to characterize your research design. There should be an evaluation plan in this section. (For DS students, this normally means using manually labelled or ground truth data.)
In this thesis, both quantitative and qualitative methods will be applied. The qualitative approach was used to acquire an overview of established data preprocessing techniques, machine learning algorithms.
The historical data will be collected and analyzed to develop a model. whereas quantitative approach will be used for validity of the experimentsâ€™ results and analyzing error generated.
The following steps must be taken:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collect data from UvA or kaggle
    \item Data Pre-Processing 
    \item Split the dataset into training, validation and testing set
    \item Train the models with different Privacy Enhancing Technologies
    \item Evaluate accuracy of the ML models and the errors generated 
\end{itemize}
