\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% Give the outcomes for each research question in the form of a table or graphic (with caption).
Write about your results here. Good captions to tables and/or figures are key.

% Sometimes,  especially  if  you  have  quite  different experiments or research  questions,  it makes sense to interleave the experimental setup and the results sections, so the reader does not get lost. It is then helpful to structure clearly in (sub)subsections.

Our results show that the choice of anonymization technique can have a significant impact on the accuracy of machine learning models. In particular, k-anonymity and l-diversity can result in a significant loss of accuracy, while t-closeness has a more limited impact on accuracy. This was true for both the decision tree and neural network models, and for both the medical and financial data sets.
