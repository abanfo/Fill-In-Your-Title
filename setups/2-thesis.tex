\begin{abstract}
% A summary of results should be included. Avoid citations. Maximum length is 200 words.
%Our results show that the choice of anonymization technique can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the machine learning models. In particular, k-anonymity and l-diversity can result in a significant loss of accuracy, while t-closeness has a more limited impact on accuracy. These findings have important implications for the use of anonymization techniques in the context of machine learning research.
